# Objective

The objective of this task is to evaluate the ability of a Backend Developer proficient in Nest.js, MongoDB, and Docker to design and implement components of a financial system within a software development company.

# Task Description

You are tasked with developing a portion of a financial system backend that manages transactions for a banking application. The system should be built using Nest.js, with MongoDB as the database and Docker for containerization. Your solution should adhere to best practices in software development, including modularity, scalability, and security.

# Requirements

1. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
    - Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints. Users should be able to register, log in, and access protected resources based on their roles.

2. **Transaction Management:**
    - Develop APIs to facilitate various types of transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts. Ensure that transactions are atomic and consistent.

3. **Account Management:**
    - Create APIs to manage user accounts, including the ability to create new accounts, retrieve account details, and list transactions associated with a specific account.

4. **Data Validation and Error Handling:**
    - Implement validation mechanisms to ensure that data integrity is maintained throughout the system. Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.

5. **Logging and Monitoring:**
    - Incorporate logging functionality to track important events and actions within the system. Integrate monitoring tools or mechanisms to detect and respond to anomalies or performance issues.

6. **Containerization with Docker:**
    - Dockerize the application to ensure easy deployment and scalability. Provide clear instructions on how to build and run the application using Docker containers.

7. **Documentation and Testing:**
    - Document your code thoroughly, including explanations of key architectural decisions and usage instructions. Write unit tests to validate the functionality of critical components.

# Submission Guidelines

- You are required to submit your solution as a Git repository hosted on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.
- Include a README.md file with instructions on how to set up and run the application locally.
- Provide any additional documentation or notes that you think would help understand your solution.

# Evaluation Criteria

- **Adherence to Requirements:** The solution should meet all the specified requirements.
- **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable.
- **Security:** Security considerations should be adequately addressed.
- **Performance:** The application should be efficient and scalable.
- **Documentation:** The codebase should be well-documented, including usage instructions and explanations of design decisions.
- **Testing:** There should be sufficient unit tests to ensure the reliability of the code.
- **Dockerization:** The application should be properly containerized and easy to deploy using Docker.
